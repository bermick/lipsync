# lipsync
Basic Lip Sync with Machine Learning and Adobe Edge

Generates a 'talking' animation, using a three layer Neural Network.  The NN was developed using Octave but the code can be easily opened
with Matlab.

Its basic because it only opens and closes mouth when appropiate.

Future updates will include:

1. Use GSAP Tween animation library instead of Adobe Edge (since the later is deprecated)
2. Generate different phonemes for a more realistic animation.
